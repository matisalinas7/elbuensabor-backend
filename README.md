# 🍔 El Buen Sabor – Backend API

REST API developed with **Spring Boot** for a food business management system.
The project focuses on **clean architecture**, **security**, and **scalability**, providing a robust backend for managing users, products, and orders.

> **Note:** Developed as an **Academic Project** for the "Desarrollo de Software" course, focusing on backend best practices and layered architecture.

## 🎯 System Overview

The system is designed to digitize the administration of a gastronomy business through a secure RESTful API.

### 🔑 Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
The application implements security rules using JWT, differentiating access levels for:
- **Admin:** Full access to manage users, catalogue (products/ingredients), and view all orders.
- **Employee:** Operational access to manage orders and update states.
- **Client:** Access to browse products, place orders, and view personal order history.

### 📦 Data Management Capabilities
- **Product Management:** Complete CRUD for products and categories.
- **Order Processing:** Lifecycle management of orders from creation to completion.
- **Soft Delete:** Implementation of logical deletion strategies to maintain data integrity and history.

---

## 🚀 Technical Features

- **Architecture:** Layered REST API (Controller, Service, Repository) ensuring separation of concerns.
- **Security:** Stateless authentication using **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** with custom filters.
- **Data Integrity:** **Soft Delete** implementation using Hibernate `@SQLDelete`.
- **Tech Stack:** Java 17, Spring Boot 3, Gradle, H2.
